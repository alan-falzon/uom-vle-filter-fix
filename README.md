# uom-vle-filter-fix
## Use
This script is a workaround for an issue which can be encountered on the UoM VLE. 

Usually a user is required to select the 'All' filter, and then select the preferred academic year to filter the study units to view. 
This script refreshes the classes of the user's study units after the page loads.

## Requirements
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en">Tampermonkey (Chrome)</a> or similar extensions for web browsers</li>
<li>UoM Account and VLE access</li>
</ul>

## Installation
The script is added to the DOM during the loading of the <a href="https://www.um.edu.mt/vle/my/">VLE Page</a>. This can be done by using Tampermonkey (or similar add-ons) on your favourite browser.

## Testing and Evaluation
The script was tested on Google Chrome (26th September, 2016).
